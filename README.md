# 2Talk


I am aiming to develop a hybrid of client-server and P2P application.
The project provides till now the following functionalities:
- chating in console between the two interlocutors;
- sending/receiving files;
- changing current directory for every interlocutor on their local machine.


## Usage

### Compile

make

### Run

First run server, then client!

- SERVER: ./server server_name server_port
- CLIENT: ./client client_name client_port server_ip server_port

### Functionalities

- chat: chat
- cd: cd absolut_path_to_the_directory
- send file: file-transfer file_name


## TODO

- retrieving video/sound information
